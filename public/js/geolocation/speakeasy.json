    "entry": "You'll need to follow them on social media (citywineryatl on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) where, every week, they'll release a name. Once you've received it, head out to PCM; there's an unmarked door on the left side of the art supply shop Binders, where you'll find a door guy waiting for you to tell him that name you heard, or, you know, to just stare at you like you're in the wrong place."

The place is named after an 'in-house sage' who throws monthly meetups for ladies at one of the designated tables, where featured speakers break down all things life. If you're not female and find yourself uninvited, just go any other time -- there are great chicharones and charcuterie to go with your 'Brown Thrasher' concoction of bourbon, lemon, Amaro Averna, and hickory-smoked apple shrub.",

Red Phone Booth is a prohibition experience featuring an extensive classic craft cocktail program. Patrons will notice the finest attention to detail that provides for exceptional cocktails including 100% fresh squeezed juices such as blood orange, mango, and cranberry, hand chipped double-reverse osmosis ice, garnishes cut to order, a collection of some of the rarest liquors available and over a dozen tinctures, bitters and flavoring agents to help breath new depth. Small plates including fresh seafood, carpaccio, Neapolitan pizza and house made desserts. Showcasing the 1920s speakeasy theme, the venue has restored original brick floors, a honey onyx bar, intimate fireplace, custom Italian leather couches, and hand-painted ceiling with back lighting. A private 'mob-style' kitchen complete with poker and pool tables is available to rent for private events.",

This means you can get delicious tender smoked wings and other great meat madness to layer your stomach with before you walk through the bookshelf door that leads to the hidden middle bar above The Music Room, which they also own. Things are pretty simple -- if you have a favorite drink, ask them and they can either make it or make up something similar -- and there are great DJs pretty much nightly, along with events like comedy open mic on Sundays at 9pm. They also share a free parking lot with Noni's.",

Expect an industry crowd early in the week, where other bartenders and service staff get their drinks even more low-priced than you, but that only makes it easier to pick up a seedy/sexy bartender or server. Also, if you see people dancing, there's a good chance that they've been partying all day/night, so be prepared to walk around them as they groove to DJs like Speakerfoxxx -- which inspires some quixotic and jerky dance moves.",

Drinks veer toward both ends of the stiff/sweet spectrum, while a limited menu of upscale bar bites offers choices for sharing or solo snacking. Drinking is also pretty throwback-fancy -- ask for a classic Sazerac, or get house cocktails like the Time on a Beach, with light rum, Fernet Branca, citrus/mint, and pisco",

GA did, however, take away the requirement to have a high number of their 'Brewniversity' loyalty points to drink the good stuff, and made it so you can get in there and enjoy premium brews -- about a dozen drafts, 50+ bottles, and a secret stash of 750ml brews that start around $20. There's also a smaller, separate food menu that includes beer-brined wings, flatbreads, truffle fries, and knockwurst with bacon-braised onions.",

Ask for the Frank Sinatra table if you're really believing you belong.",

To be a member, there is a waiting list to get on a waiting list! Find a way to get that done, then go past the kitchen line to a oversized door made of black bonded leather with a peep-hole smack dab in the center. You must have an exclusive RFD card to unlock the door from the outside."

BBP keeps a great, rare 750ml cask beer situation, and hosts a ton of events that make it not as stuffy as other local speakeasy-ish joints (read: Argo-Skee, date night comedy shows, weekly all-vinyl DJ parties and more).
